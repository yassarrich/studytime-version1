<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About My Project

This is a personal project where I was looking to expand my skills with frontend development, throughout my time as a college student I found myself using a variety of tools in order to keep track of my todos as well as pomodoro timer in order to keep myself as focused as possible. It was hard to find a website which fit all my needs so I have begun building it!
